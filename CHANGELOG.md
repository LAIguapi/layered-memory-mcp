## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed — Dynamic agent-memory limit detection (root-cause of silent bloat)

The framework's lazy compaction silently failed to fire when agent memory
actually overflowed, because it could not see the *real* capacity limit.

**Root cause:** `_get_memory_max_chars` defaulted to a hard-coded `50_000`
chars and only honored the `MEMORY_MAX_CHARS` env var. Hermes' real memory
limit lives in `config.yaml` (`memory.memory_char_limit`, default 2000,
user-adjustable). With no env var set, the framework thought capacity was
50000 while the true limit was 4000 — so a 3974-char (≈99% full) MEMORY.md
registered as ~8% usage and never tripped the compaction threshold.

**Fix:** the limit is now resolved through a priority chain that reads the
user's actual configuration instead of guessing:

1. explicit `config.memory_char_limit`
2. `MEMORY_MAX_CHARS` env var
3. **dynamic read of Hermes `config.yaml` `memory.{memory,user}_char_limit`**
   (tracks whatever the user set — 2000, 4000, 8000…)
4. smart default by memory-file type (Hermes-style `§` memory → 2000,
   generic → 50000)

New helpers in `memory_compactor.py`: `_find_hermes_config()`,
`_read_hermes_memory_limit(is_user_profile)`, `_is_hermes_memory_path()`,
`_is_user_profile_path()`. `_get_memory_max_chars()` now takes `config` and
`memory_path` so it can pick the right limit (MEMORY.md vs USER.md) and the
right fallback. `detect_memory_bloat` and `auto_maintain_after_write` pass
both through.

`HERMES_CONFIG_PATH` env var (set by Hermes in the MCP server's env) is the
preferred config locator; falls back to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

### Added — Trigger C: critical-usage safety net

`auto_maintain_after_write` gains a third compaction trigger: when usage
reaches `compact_critical_threshold` (default 0.95) **and** there is bloat to
migrate, compaction fires immediately, ignoring the `auto_maintain_interval`.
This catches the case where bloat was written straight to native memory
(bypassing `inject_knowledge`) and the 7-day interval hasn't elapsed.

### Added — Ride-along self-maintenance on `get_l0_index`

Under stdio (Hermes' mode), the MCP process is short-lived, so a background
daemon thread can't run periodic maintenance. Instead, `get_l0_index` — the
highest-frequency tool, called at the start of nearly every session — now
piggybacks a best-effort `auto_maintain_after_write` check. This gives the
framework a real chance to self-maintain even when the agent only ever writes
to native memory and never calls `inject_knowledge`. Failures are swallowed so
maintenance can never break index retrieval.

### Added — Config

- `compact_critical_threshold` (0–1, default 0.95, env
  `LAYERED_MEMORY_COMPACT_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD`), range-validated.
- `memory_char_limit` (explicit override, env `MEMORY_MAX_CHARS`).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added — Rot Auditor (`audit_rot` tool)

A new **read-only** diagnostic tool, `audit_rot`, surfaces knowledge-base decay
before it accumulates. It detects the four common rot pathologies seen in
long-lived layered-memory stores:

- **oversized** — files grown past the recommended size (often from
  "append-but-never-merge" accumulation).
- **garbled_heading** — section headings that lost their punctuation/spaces
  (a run of characters with no separators), e.g. from an older summariser bug
  or hand-edited memory. CJK-, CamelCase-, and punctuation-aware so genuine
  headings aren't flagged.
- **stale** — sections carrying a transient marker (`下次执行`, `待测试`,
  `TODO`, `临时`, …) **together with** an expired date in the heading/lead.
  Requiring both keeps false positives low — a standing TODO list or a passing
  mention of "临时" is not flagged.
- **cross_file_duplicate** — near-duplicate sections living in different files,
  i.e. the same knowledge defined in more than one place.
- **same_file_duplicate** — near-duplicate sections within the *same* file: the
  classic "append but never merge" rot (often left behind by a dual-write that
  created two copies of one section).

Returns a health score (0–100), per-pathology findings, and consolidation
recommendations. Makes no changes — designed to be run periodically (e.g. a
weekly cron) so a human can decide what to consolidate.

### Fixed — Summariser corrupted snake_case identifiers

`_summarize_for_l0` stripped **all** underscores via a naive `[*_`#]` regex,
turning `enabled_toolsets` into `enabledtoolsets` and `fallback_providers` into
`fallbackproviders` in generated L0 pointers. The summariser now strips only
paired emphasis/code markers and leading heading hashes, preserving underscores
inside identifiers and file paths while still removing `_italic_` spans.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added — Auto-Maintain (write-triggered self-maintenance)

The layered architecture introduced an **L1↔agent-memory dual-write**: every
`inject_knowledge` writes the knowledge to an L1 file *and* needs the resulting
L0 pointer mirrored into the agent's memory store. Previously the agent had to
do that second write manually (and remember to compact when memory filled up),
which was error-prone — agents forgot to sync pointers, or let memory overflow.

The framework now **owns the complexity it introduced**. After each write it
self-maintains, riding along on the natural `inject_knowledge` call (stdio-safe,
no background thread):

- **Dual-write completion** — automatically writes/updates the L0 pointer in
  agent memory (adds if missing, replaces a stale pointer to the same L1 file).
  The agent no longer needs to manually mirror pointers.
- **Lazy compaction** — when agent memory exceeds `compact_bloat_threshold`,
  **or** more than `auto_maintain_interval_days` (default 7) have elapsed since
  the last pass, runs `compact_memory()` to migrate bloat to L1 and slim memory
  back to pointers. Tracked via a `.last_auto_compact` marker in the home dir.

Maintenance fails silently — it never breaks the primary write.

### Configuration

- `LAYERED_MEMORY_AUTO_MAINTAIN`: enable/disable auto-maintain (default: `true`)
- `LAYERED_MEMORY_AUTO_MAINTAIN_INTERVAL_DAYS`: min days between auto-compaction
  passes (default: `7`)

When disabled, falls back to the legacy advisory `memory_bloat_warning`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-08

### Changed — Agent-Agnostic Architecture

- **Removed** all Hermes-specific hardcodes from compact/detect pipeline
- **Added** auto-detection of agent memory file path (Hermes/Claude/Cursor/Cline/Generic)
- **Added** configurable entry separator (`LAYERED_MEMORY_AGENT_MEMORY_SEPARATOR` env var)
- `detect_memory_bloat()` and `compact_memory()` now auto-detect agent memory via config
- `inject_knowledge` hint is now agent-agnostic English (was Chinese + Hermes-specific)
- `init_framework` returns unified rules (removed Hermes vs generic split)
- `_parse_entries()` accepts `separator` parameter (default `§` for backward compat)

### Configuration

- `LAYERED_MEMORY_AGENT_MEMORY_PATH`: explicit agent memory file path
- `LAYERED_MEMORY_AGENT_MEMORY_SEPARATOR`: entry separator (default: `§`)
- Auto-detect order: explicit → Hermes → Claude Code → Cursor → Cline → Generic
